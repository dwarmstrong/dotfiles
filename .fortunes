Our actions may be impeded ... but there can be no impeding our intentions or
dispositions. Because we can accomodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts
to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impedement to action
advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.

Consider this: for decades humanity has possessed the capability to expand into
our solar system - but we have not. It's not because explorers like you weren't
willing to shoulder the risk. Instead it was the blindness among our leaders
that prevented them from seeing the true risk. And yet on Earth, we spend a
trillion dollars on war without blinking an eye. With each passing year, the
chance of a global catastrophe mounts - the climate, an epidemic, a financial
crisis, or a war that shrouds and prevents us from reaching space. Possibly
ever again. Humanity's future depends on going - now, not later... I ask you to
take this risk for the best reason of all - to secure the lives of countless
generations to come. To finally embark humanity into the cosmos.

I feel that you are entering an age of metamorphosis; that you will decide to
cast aside your entire history, your entire heritage and all that remains of
natural humanity - whose image, magnified into beautiful tragedy, is the focus
of the mirrors of your beliefs; that you will advance (for there is no other
way), and in this, which for you is now only a leap into the abyss, you will
find a challenge, if not a beauty; and that you will proceed in your own way
after all, since in casting off man, man will save himself.

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man
stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit
belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust
and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and
again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does
actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great
devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the
end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at
least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those
cold andtimid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

The Olympus Mons mountain on Mars is so tall and yet so gently sloped that,
were you suited and supplied correctly, ascending it would allow you to walk
most of the way to space. Mars has a big, puffy atmosphere, taller than ours,
but there’s barely anything to it at that level. 30 Pascals of pressure, which
is what we get in an industrial vacuum furnace here on Earth. You may as well
be in space. Imagine that. Imagine a world where you could quite literally
walk to space.

Once upon a time, I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, 
to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of following 
my fancies as a butterfly, and was unconscious of my individuality as a man. 
Suddenly, I awake, and there I lay, myself again. Now I do not know whether 
I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly
dreaming that I am a man.

The Guest House

This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.
A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.
Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they're a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still, treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.
The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.
Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.

Why? On account of the great geographical discoveries, the important scientific
results? Oh no; that will come later, for the few specialists. This is something
all can understand. A victory of human mind and human strength over the dominion
and powers of Nature; a deed that lifts us above the great monotony of daily
life; a view over shining plains, with lofty mountains against the cold blue
sky, and lands covered by ice-sheets of inconceivable extent ... the triumph of
the living over the stiffened realm of death.

There is no way back into the past; the choice, as Wells once said, is the
universe – or nothing. Though men and civilizations may yearn for rest, for
the dream of the lotus-eaters, that is a desire that merges imperceptibly
into death. The challenge of the great spaces between the worlds is a
stupendous one; but if we fail to meet it, the story of our race will be
drawing to its close.

Our remote descendants, safely arrayed on many worlds throughout the
Solar System and beyond, will be unified by their common heritage, by
their regard for their home planet, and by the knowledge that, whatever
other life may be, the only humans in all the Universe come from Earth.
They will gaze up and strain to find the blue dot in their skies. They
will love it no less for its obscurity and fragility. They will marvel
at how vulnerable the repository of all our potential once was, how
perilous our infancy, how humble our beginnings, how many rivers we had
to cross before we found our way.

An empty pageant: a stage play; flocks of sheep, herds of cattle; a bone flung
among a pack of dogs; a crumb tossed into a pond of fish; ants, loaded and

is life.

In the midst of it all you must take your stand, good-temperedly and without
disdain; yet always aware that **a man's worth is no greater than the worth of
his ambitions.**

Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation) there is one elementary truth,
the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment
one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves too. All sorts of things
occur to help one that would not otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of
events issues from the decision, raising in one's favour all manner of unforseen
incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man would have dreamed 
would come his way. I have learned a deep respect for one of Goethe's couplets:
"Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, magic,
and power in it. Begin it now."

Defeat, my Defeat, my solitude and my aloofness;
You are dearer to me than a thousand triumphs,
And sweeter to my heart than all worldglory.

Defeat, my Defeat, my self-knowledge and my defiance,
Through you I know that I am yet young and swift of foot
And not to be trapped by withering laurels.
And in you I have found aloneness
And the joy of being shunned and scorned.

Defeat, my Defeat, my shining sword and shield,
In your eyes I have read
That to be enthroned is to be enslaved,
And to be understood is to be levelled down,
And to be grasped is but to reach one’s fullness
And like a ripe fruit to fall and be consumed.

Defeat, my Defeat, my bold companion,
You shall hear my songs and my cries and my silences,
And none but you shall speak to me of the beating of wings,
And urging of seas,
And of mountains that burn in the night,
And you alone shall climb my steep and rocky soul.

Defeat, my Defeat, my deathless courage,
You and I shall laugh together with the storm,
And together we shall dig graves for all that die in us,
And we shall stand in the sun with a will,
And we shall be dangerous.

For what its worth
its never too late
to be whoever you want to be.
There's no time limit.
Start whenever you want.
You can change
or stay the same
there are no rules to this thing.
You can make the best or the worst of it.
I hope you make the best of it.
I hope you see things that startle you.
I hope you feel things you never felt before.
I hope you meet people with a different point of view.
I hope you live a life you're proud of.
If you find that you're not
I hope you have the strength
to start all over again.
